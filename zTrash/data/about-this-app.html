<p bgcolor="#0000FF"><img src="1139" char="|"></p><p></p><p>This app is dedicated to His Holiness, Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, known to all of us affectionately as "Gurudeva." May his divine presence bring you peace, joy, wisdom, understanding and the spiritual will to awaken the Divine Being that lies within you, which was his most cherished wish for everyone who came to him.</p><p></p><p align="center"><img src="1173" char="|"></p><p></p><p>The core of this app comprises Gurudeva's photos and quotes from his writings and talks. The main screen chooses a random photo from hundreds of pictures of Gurudeva taken over the years coupled with a quote. The quotes are taken from the entire collection or from your favorites or from the category you have choosen (see below). If the photo shifts slightly when it first appears, that means there is more to see and you can use your finger to move it around and reveal more of the image. Click on the left and the right of the quote to see another image or quote. </p><p></p><p>The tools at the bottom of the screen give you options related to the quotes and additional navigation. Click on the last icon with three dots to go to more features, including audio.</p><p></p><p align="center"><img src="1172" char="|"></p><p></p><p>Click here to go to <a>Help info</a> on how to use this app.</p><p></p><p>Please feel free to comment on this app and send your "user stories" for future apps that may help guide production of our next app. If you find any bugs, try to reproduce the event and send us a "recipe" for what you did and what happened.
